# Neural Networks and Deep Learning

This repository contains the code and report for three assignments that I submitted to the course Neural Networks and Deep Learning at the University of Padova in the winter term 2021 / 2022. 
The first assignment covers supervised learning and includes a regression as well as a classification problem. The Second assignment covers unsupervised learning, where I implemented an Autoencoder and well as a Variational Autoencoder on the Fasion-MNIST dataset. The third assigment covers reinforcement learning, where an agent learns to play a simple atari game (Cart-pole).
